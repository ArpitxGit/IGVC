# IGVC  
## Project Description
In-Game Verifiable Credentials (IGVC) is a system that allows players to earn and showcase achievements, rewards, and their in-game identities using blockchain-based Verifiable Credentials. This project aims to enhance the gaming experience by providing a secure and tamper-proof way to verify in-game accomplishments and identities. IGVC will empower players to take ownership of their in-game achievements and rewards, making them more valuable and transferable across games and platforms.

## Project Goals
Verifiable Achievements: Implement a system that enables the issuance and verification of verifiable credentials for in-game achievements and rewards.

User Identity on Blockchain: Allow players to create and manage their in-game identities using decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and have control over their identity data.

Cross-Game Compatibility: Ensure that IGVC is compatible with various games and platforms, making in-game achievements and rewards more transferable.

Security and Trust: Enhance security by leveraging blockchain technology, making in-game credentials tamper-proof and trustworthy.

User-Friendly Experience: Develop a user-friendly interface for players to manage their verifiable credentials, DIDs, and in-game identities.

Documentation and Support: Provide thorough documentation and support for developers to integrate IGVC into their games.
